# Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in designing a healthcare interoperability pipeline using FHIR standards.

I learned how infrastructure, semantic rules, and data translation work together to ensure safe and interoperable healthcare data exchange. Containerization using Docker simplified deployment, while FHIR profiles enforced clinical data quality.

Overall, this exercise helped me transition from thinking as a data modeller to thinking as a systems architect in healthcare IT.
