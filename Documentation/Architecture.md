# System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and data integrity.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Source Layer
Legacy healthcare data exists in flat CSV files generated by older hospital systems.

### 2. Translator Layer
A Python-based translator reads the CSV data and converts each row into a corresponding FHIR resource. UUIDs are generated to ensure globally unique identifiers.

### 3. Rulebook Layer
FHIR Shorthand (FSH) profiles define mandatory fields and constraints, ensuring clinical and semantic validity of the data.

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
A containerized HAPI FHIR server runs inside Docker, providing a validated and standards-compliant data store.

This layered approach ensures maintainability, validation, and scalability.
